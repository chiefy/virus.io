## Objective

Create new cells and become bigger.

## Death

A player's game concludes when all of their cells have been stolen by other players. They leave behind a small grave, a grave represents one cell.

## Creating Cells

In order to create cells you must collect items on the map. Items include sugar, water, and earth. In order to create a new cell, the player must have one of each of those items. The player can accumulate as many items as they can collect. After they have one of each item, they create a new cell automatically.

## Collectable Resources

  * water
  * sugar
  * earth
  * grave (dead player, one cell)

## Stealing Other Players' Cells

When two players collide the player with the larger cell count "steals" whatever cell they touch. When the players cell count reaches zero (all cells stolen), they die and leave behind a grave collectable which is worth one cell.

## Cell Types

There are several graphical representations of cell sizes:

  * 1 cell
  * 5 cell 
  * 10 cell
  * 100 cell
  * 1000 cell
  * connector cell (shows bonds to cell sizes in between these sizes)
